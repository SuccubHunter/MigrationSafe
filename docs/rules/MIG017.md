# MIG017 — SQL Batch Migration

## Problem
A migration processes a large volume of data in a single operation.

## Why This Is Dangerous
Large transactions increase lock time, WAL usage, and rollback cost.

## Recommended Solutions
- Split migration into batches.
- Commit periodically.
- Monitor execution time.
