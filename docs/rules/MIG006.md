# MIG006 — Execute Raw SQL

## Problem
Raw SQL is executed directly in a migration.

## Why This Is Dangerous
Raw SQL is difficult to statically analyze and may hide dangerous operations such as full-table updates or locks.

## Recommended Solutions
- Prefer Alembic operations API when possible.
- Clearly document raw SQL intent and impact.
- Avoid complex or destructive SQL in migrations.
