# MIG004 — Drop Column

## Problem
A column is dropped from a table.

## Why This Is Dangerous
Dropping a column permanently removes data and may break application code, views, triggers, or reports that depend on it.

## Recommended Solutions
- Stop using the column in application code first.
- Deprecate the column.
- Remove it in a separate, well-planned migration.
