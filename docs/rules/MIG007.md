# MIG007 — SQL ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN NOT NULL

## Problem
ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN with a NOT NULL constraint and no default value.

## Why This Is Dangerous
This operation forces PostgreSQL to rewrite the table and acquire exclusive locks.

## Recommended Solutions
- Add the column as nullable.
- Backfill data in controlled batches.
- Add the NOT NULL constraint separately.
