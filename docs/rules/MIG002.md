# MIG002 — Create Index Without CONCURRENTLY

## Problem
An index is created without using the CONCURRENTLY option.

## Why This Is Dangerous
CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY blocks all writes to the table until the index build completes, which can take minutes or hours on large tables.

## Recommended Solutions
- Use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY.
- Run the command outside of a transaction.
