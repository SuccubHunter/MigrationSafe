# MIG005 — Alter Column Type

## Problem
The data type of an existing column is changed.

## Why This Is Dangerous
ALTER COLUMN TYPE may require a full table rewrite, can block access, and may result in data loss if the cast is unsafe.

## Recommended Solutions
- Create a new column with the desired type.
- Migrate data in batches.
- Switch application logic to the new column.
- Drop the old column afterward.
