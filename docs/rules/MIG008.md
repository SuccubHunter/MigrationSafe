# MIG008 — SQL CREATE INDEX WITHOUT CONCURRENTLY

## Problem
CREATE INDEX is executed without CONCURRENTLY.

## Why This Is Dangerous
The table is locked for writes during index creation.

## Recommended Solutions
- Use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY.
- Ensure the migration framework allows non-transactional execution.
